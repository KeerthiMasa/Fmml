Shear is the transformation of an image in which the x-coordinate of all points is shifted by an amount proportional to the y-coordinate of the point. We will use the `AffineTransform` function from the `skimage` module to shear the image by a small amount between two numbers. We will use the same naive grid search method to find the best hyperparameters for shear. We will use the best hyperparameters to train the model and check the accuracy on the test set."
