There are 20640 samples, each with 8 attributes like income of the block, age of the houses per district etc. The task is to predict the cost of the houses per district. We will use the scikit-learn library to load the data and perform some basic data preprocessing and model training. We will also show how to evaluate the model using some common metrics, split the data into training and testing sets, and use cross-validation to get a better estimate of the model's performance."

        "Reduced Variance: A single split can be biased if the dataset is imbalanced or if the split happens to poorly represent the overall data distribution. Averaging across multiple splits mitigates this.\n",

        "Better Generalization Estimate: Multiple splits provide a more robust measure of how the model performs on unseen data.\n",

        "Averaging across splits gives a better estimate of test accuracy for the following reasons:\n",

        "Closer Approximation of Real Performance: By training and validating the model on different subsets of data, you simulate how it would perform in real-world scenarios with unseen data.\n",
